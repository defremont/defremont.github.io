        I like to develop apps with a great user experience (<strong>UX/UI</strong>) and with performance enhancing technologies like static websites and services. In recent years, I have learned the main and latest tools for this purpose. I work regularly with <strong> NodeJS </strong>, <strong> Vue.js </strong>, <strong> Hyperledger </strong>, <strong> SASS </strong>, <strong> JavaScript </strong>, <strong> TypeScript </strong>, <strong> React </strong>, <strong> AngularJS </strong> and <strong> CouchDB </strong>.

        One of my biggest hobbies is creating artistic content for the digital world. <strong> Aseprite </strong> and <strong> Pen Tablet</strong> are my greatest companions for this.
