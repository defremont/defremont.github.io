        I like to develop sites with a great user experience (<strong>UX/UI</strong>) and with performance enhancing technologies like static websites and services.

I work regularly with <strong> Java </strong>, <strong> PHP </strong>, <strong> HTML5 </strong>, <strong> CSS3 </strong>, <strong> JavaScript </strong>, <strong> TypeScript </strong>, <strong> React </strong>, <strong> AngularJS </strong> and <strong> Ruby </strong>.
